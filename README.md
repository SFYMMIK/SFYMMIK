- 15 y/o systems & software enthusiast
- I like building things from scratch — from kernels to filesystems to programming languages

## Projects

- **MVConverter** — Minimalistic Python tool to convert video files into audio (WAV/MP3).

## About

I like things simple, open, and honest. If you’re into low-level systems, programming languages, or just want to see cool experiments — you’re in the right place.
