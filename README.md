## everything i do here is startimg to be meaningless, every now and then i would get called being a genius programmer for a 14 year old, but i can just say that, fuck this shit, i am not passing this semester in my school, almost every grade is a 1 (F for anyone from USA or UK or smth), like if i dont pass this grade i cannot become who i want to be, right now im at my lowest point in life, even though i can program a lot of things if i keep this up i wont pass this grade to go to highschool and if i dont... well it will explain the situation itself, the only thing keeping me atleast a bit not worried about it is the nicotine going through my brain, im just tweaking everywhere i am tweaking because of the thought of not passing is already killing me inside, i cannot go a day without nicotine probably the only thing keeping me a bit happy is my friends and nicotine its complicated, i dont have problems at home for everyone i have great parents and i know that, they want everything for me to turn out best, i know they try their best everyday, i cant imagine going to a job for 8 hours and still have work at home, now i dont know what i am even typing here, no one will see this i know that, and no help is needed my current mental state is just like that, and if anyone reads this no i dont have depression, no feeling can be seen from me my life is will be meaningless if i dont pass this grade, why the fuck am i even still thinking about it?, this .md file now looks like a private notebook as i interpret it but right now nothing will be better than this, none of my projects are seen and i can choose between studying or something or just code the feeling just feels like hell and i need to understand that no one will want to take me into highschool if grades will be like this and even looking at myself in the mirror disgusts me, i am overweight because of my body, i am dostroying it piece by piece and i cant change that too addicted to everything my views on everything have changed not only on myself but on every aspect ideologies too now some might hate me some might like me, but i just cannot hide it as a secret anymore anyone who has met me online knows im neo-nazi, oh my god what is even the point of this im just not normal like everyone and i need to understand that why cant i?
